                <h2>ESSENCE OF KAISHIKA PURAANAM</h2>
                <div class="puranam-content">
                    <p>Nampaadduvaan makes 18 promises that night to the rakshasa and states that if he fails even in one of those 18 promises, he will be a party to 18 sins. The 18th promise of Nampaadduvaan is the essence of the Kaisika Puraanam.</p><br>
                    <p>Nampaadduvaan says that the sin of anyone trying to equate Lord Narayana to anyone else in this world is the greatest and that he will be a party to that sin if he did not come back to the demon after meeting the Lord. If Nampaadduvaan does that then he will never get liberation from this cycle of birth and death. This promise convinced the rakshasa that Nampaadduvaan would return and he let him go. Nampaadduvaan spent the entire night at the Thirukurungkudi Nambi temple and then made his way back to the Rakshasha as promised. </p><br>
                    <p>As Nampaadduvaan is returning back to the rakshasa, the Lord disguised Himself as an old brahmin and stopped Nampaadduvaan and asked him the reason for rushing back quick, much in contrast to his usually slow and thoughtful walk. Nampaadduvaan explains his situation to the brahmin, who condemns him as a fool and offers protection from the rakshasa.</p><br>
                    <p>Nampaadduvaan rejects this offer stating his promise to return as quickly as possible. He informs the Brahmin that he will not hesitate to give up his own life if he has to but he will never go back on his word. He gave the demon a promise and he has to fulfil it. He has to go back to the rakshasa and become his meal. </p><br>
                    <p> By the Lords grace, the rakshasa changed his mind by the time Nampaadduvaan reached the spot and he no longer wanted to feast on Nampaadduvaan. Shri Vaishnav acharyas mention that the change was due to small fraction of association with the great devotee Nampaadduvaan. It is said in the scriptures lava matra sadhu sanga sarva siddhi haya.</p><br>
                    <p> With a completely changed mind, the rakshasa now asked for the fruits of all the praise that Nampaadduvaan had sung in glorification of the Lord Thirukurungudi Nambi during his visits to the temple every night.</p><br>
                    <p>As an act of mercy, Nampaadduvaan shared with the rakshasa the Kaishika Puraanam the songs which he had sung that very night in front of Lord Nambi of ThiruKurungkudi. Thus, Nampaadduvaan helped secure entry into Vaikuntha for the rakshasa. It is believed that anyone who recites/reads or listens to the Kaishika Puraanam will attain Vaikuntha within this very life. </p>
